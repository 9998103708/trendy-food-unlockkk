		 <table><p align="justify"><h4>Hi! I am Hiral.. the founder and creator of Trendy Food Unlock! I am 22years old.I am a self-taught (still learning) home-baker, Blogger and Vlogger. I enjoy styling the food I make and clicking pictures of it. It is not just the recipe website, it is the sharing diffrent kind of foods from cafes, restaurants and Street Food. It is community where the food lovers/cooking beginners discuss about their successes, failures, learning process in the kitchen.
Playing around with different cuisines, flavours, ingredients and basically everything related to food is my favourite thing to do. This blog is my way of sharing my passion with the world. I hope you enjoy the treats! Apart from these you can find some international cuisines recipes and some fusion recipes and places with Indian touch.<br><br>
 A large chunk of my day is spent in the kitchen scribbling inside my diary and experimenting with flavours, baking something, tasting it, making notes again, photographing and styling. My love for photography is indescribable.Somehow, along the way my camera became the love of my life. I absolutely love being around food from start to finish. Making and documenting the process, sharing that story through my lens is what I want to do all my life.<br><br>

 Letus just say, I am always up for learning new things and knowing peoples stories. Hit me up here if you want to have a conversation with me! Or just leave a comment on my social media.<br><br>
